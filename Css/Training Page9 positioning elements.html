	<p>A soldier came marching along the high road: &quot;Left, right -- left, right.&quot; He had his knapsack on his back, and a sword at his side; he had been to the wars, and was now returning home. </p>
		<div id="box5">
	Box 5
	</div>
	<p>As he walked on, he met a very frightful-looking old witch in the road. Her under-lip hung quite down on her breast, and she stopped and said, &quot;Good evening, soldier; you have a very fine sword, and a large knapsack, and you are a real soldier; so you shall have as much money as ever you like.&quot; </p>
	<p>&quot;Thank you, old witch,&quot; said the soldier. </p>
